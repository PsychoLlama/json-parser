# json-parser
A hand-rolled AST parser for JSON. Because... reasons?

## Project Status
:checkered_flag: Done

I wrote this for fun, and it's finished. It isn't a serious project.

## Building Locally
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/PsychoLlama/json-parser.git
$ cd json-parser
$ yarn

# Prints the generated AST of package.json to stdout
$ ./dist/cli.js package.json
```
